    <h3>Koenigsegg</h3>
    <p>Koenigsegg’s CFD team has devised an aero and intake package for Sadair’s Spear that manages the air like never before, bringing usable downforce into play earlier at more typical track speeds while improving airflow around the car at high speed, as well as improved breathing and cooling. Sadair’s Spear features a new, active, top-mounted rear wing with a double-blade design featuring a straight profile optimised for greater downforce at lower speeds. This is complimented by underfloor strakes and wheel arch louvres that improve airflow around and underneath the car.</p>
