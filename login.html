    <h1>Dark Matter Engine</h1>
    <p>To compliment the engine and the LSTT, and with space for only one e-motor in the
re-designed Gemera, the Koenigsegg R&D team explored the limits of electric propulsion
and created the Dark Matter e-motor – an 800 hp, 1250 Nm patent-pending Raxial Flux
e-motor. With the Dark Matter e-motor fitted, the Gemera drivetrain is now lighter, has a
smaller footprint and is more engaging. Dark Matter is also the world’s most powerful
automotive-grade e-motor with 6-phase technology.</p>
